# Coding the Humanities

## 1. Tools

*Concepts:* Produces, Consumer, Editor, Server, Browser, Interface, Console, Automation, Crafts, Engineering

Tools shape and transform our research and learning. This introductory session critically looks at the digital tools that we use in the humanities. 


## 2. Language

*Concepts:* Natural Language, Artificial Language, Performativity, Code, Event, Procedure

In this session we discuss the concept of language both in the humanities and in programming. We start from the usual distinction between natural and artificial languages but quickly conclude that this dichotomy may not be as useful as it initially seems.

Instead, we will start from the distinction between descriptive and performative languages. A concept that was originally coined by J.J. Austin's in 'How to Things with Words?' (1962),

Performativity is frequently used across the humanities to designate the fact that language does not only describe the world, but is also a way to (inter)act with(in) it. Code, however, pushes this theory of language even further, since it is literally performative. As the German media theorist Friedrich Kittler puts it "it is the only language that actually does what it says."

We deepen our understanding performativity of code through some code exercises in the browser console. Here, we encounter two different modes in which code acts: through imperatives and procedures (1) and through events (2).
